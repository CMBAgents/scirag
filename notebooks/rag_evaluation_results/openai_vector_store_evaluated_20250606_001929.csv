1,How is the standard recombination history tested in the Planck 2018 analysis?,semi-blind eigen-analysis (often referred to as a principal-component analysis),"**Answer**:

In the Planck 2018 analysis, the standard recombination history is tested using a semi-blind principal-component (eigenmode) analysis of deviations in the free-electron fraction, xe(z), from the standard recombination scenario. This approach expands perturbations in xe(z) across 80 redshift bands, constructs eigenmodes (eXeMs), and fits their amplitudes to the data; the results show no significant evidence for deviations from the standard recombination history, with all mode amplitudes consistent with zero and no impact on cosmological parameters when these modes are included【2:54-56†1807.06209v4.pdf】.

2,Which corrections in polarization spectra were implemented in the 2018 Planck analysis?,Beam leakage correction; effective polarization efficiencies; Correlated noise in auto-frequency cross-spectra and sub-pixel effects,"**Answer**:

The 2018 Planck analysis implemented several key corrections in the polarization spectra: (1) correction for beam leakage (temperature-to-polarization leakage) using QuickPol polarized beam matrices; (2) recalibration for effective polarization efficiencies by comparing frequency polarization power spectra to fiducial spectra; and (3) corrections for correlated noise in auto-frequency cross-spectra and subpixel effects. The most significant changes affecting cosmological parameters were due to the beam-leakage correction and the polarization efficiency corrections, which were applied to the TE and EE spectra .

8,Why is there an apparent preference for A_L deviating from theoretical expectations in the Planck 2018 analysis?,"In temperature, over half of the small upward shift in A_L is explained by the lower optical depth from the 2018 low-l likelihood, In polarization, the shift in A_L is explained by changes in \tau, with changes in the maps, modelling for beam leakage, and polarization efficiencies.","**Answer**:

The apparent preference for A_L deviating from theoretical expectations in the Planck 2018 analysis is primarily driven by features in the high-ℓ CMB power spectra, where the data show an oscillatory residual that mimics the effect of increased lensing smoothing, leading to a best-fit value of A_L > 1 at about 2–3σ significance. This preference is not seen in the lensing reconstruction data and may be due to statistical fluctuations, analysis choices, or possibly unknown systematics, rather than new physics, as the inclusion of lensing reconstruction pulls A_L back towards unity and reduces the tension with ΛCDM expectations .

Systematic errors in X-ray cluster masses in the Planck analysis are corrected by introducing a mass bias parameter (1−b), which accounts for the difference between true cluster masses and those estimated from X-ray observations assuming hydrostatic equilibrium. This bias is calibrated using external weak-lensing and CMB-lensing mass measurements, and the Planck analysis typically adopts a value for (1−b) based on these calibrations, with recent results finding (1−b) = 0.62 ± 0.03, and also referencing updated calibrations such as (1−b) = 0.71 ± 0.10 from CMB-lensing analyses, to correct for systematic underestimation of cluster masses in the cosmological parameter inference.

21,What differences exist in the cosmological parameters between the low and high multipole likelihoods in the Planck 2018 paper?,\Omega_mh^2 differs between the low and high multipole likelihoods at approximately the 2\sigma level,"**Answer**:

The main differences in cosmological parameters between the low and high multipole likelihoods in the Planck 2018 paper are that the high-ℓ (ℓ ≥ 802) likelihood pulls parameters towards higher matter density (Ω_m h^2), higher fluctuation amplitude (σ_8), lower scalar spectral index (n_s), and lower H_0 compared to the low-ℓ (ℓ ≤ 801) likelihood, with the difference in Ω_m h^2 being at the 2.8σ level for temperature data and about 2σ when polarization is included. These shifts are correlated and appear consistent with moderate statistical fluctuations, particularly related to the low-ℓ dip in the temperature spectrum and the lensing amplitude at high-ℓ, rather than indicating significant systematics or new physics, and the combined constraints from the full multipole range are consistent with CMB lensing and external data sets.

33,"With the symbolic regression, how do the authors of CAMELS prevent overly complicated functions for predicting the cosmological quantities being passed down the generations?","Complexity is an integer number associated to each operator, which penalises more complex operations in the functions","**Answer**:

The authors of CAMELS prevent overly complicated functions in symbolic regression by assigning a complexity value to each operator (e.g., +, −, ×, ÷ have complexity 1, while log, exp, ab have complexity 2) and penalizing more complex operations. They select expressions that achieve low training error while being compact, noting that longer expressions are only marginally more accurate and may not generalize as well as simpler ones, thus explicitly favoring parsimony in the symbolic regression process【2:2†2010.00619v2.pdf】.

35,"In CAMELS, how does the architecture of the unsupervised generative models force the model to produce better data on each iteration?",There are two networks present in the generative model: the generator and the discriminator. The former generates data that has the same properties as the original data and the latter tries to distinguish the difference between the original data and the generated data. This adverserial dynamic produces better data on each iteration.,"**Answer**:

In CAMELS, the architecture of unsupervised generative models, specifically Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), forces the model to produce better data on each iteration by pitting two networks—the generator and the discriminator—against each other: as the discriminator improves at distinguishing real from fake images, it forces the generator to create increasingly realistic data to fool the discriminator, thus iteratively improving the quality of generated data. This adversarial process ensures that the generator learns to sample from the underlying data manifold, producing outputs with statistical properties that closely match the real data, as evidenced by the agreement in power spectra and probability distribution functions between real and generated images【2:0†2010.00619v2.pdf】.

After training, the CAMELS autoencoder exhibited the surprising behavior of being able to reconstruct temperature maps from simulations with different cosmologies and astrophysics (which it was not trained on) with the same accuracy as those from the fiducial model. This suggests that the autoencoder learned a lower-dimensional manifold general enough to embed maps from other cosmological and astrophysical models, rather than just memorizing the training data, and could even identify anomalies such as the CAMELS logo as outliers, indicating it learned the structure of temperature maps specifically rather than generic image compression.

V_{max}, the maximum circular velocity of a galaxy's subhalo, is important for inferring \Omega_m because it is strongly affected by the dark matter content of galaxies, which in turn depends on \Omega_m.

62,"In the ""Cosmology with one galaxy?"" paper, what would be the expected consequences if the authors' conclusions are correct?","If the conclusions given in the ""Cosmology with one galaxy?"" are correct, it implies that it should be difficult, if not impossible, to reproduce the galaxy properties from real galaxies for cosmologies with a value of \Omega_m far away from the true one. Also, galaxy properties are known to exhibit some level of intrinsic stochasticity in numerical simulations. So, this will imply that either the manifold containing the galaxy properties will have some intrinsic tightness, or that galaxies affected by this effect will move along the manifold.","**Answer**:

If the authors' conclusions in the ""Cosmology with one galaxy?"" paper are correct, it would imply that the internal properties of individual galaxies encode enough information to constrain key cosmological parameters like Ωm with surprising precision. This would mean that galaxy properties reside in distinct manifolds for different cosmologies, making it difficult or impossible to reproduce real galaxy properties in simulations with incorrect cosmological parameters, and potentially allowing new ways to connect galaxy-scale observations with cosmological inference, provided the method can be made robust to simulation/model differences and observational uncertainties .

79,Which anchor distances had problems with being used as anchors in the determination of H_0 in the HST paper?,The distance to M31 had problems with being used as an anchor in the determination of H_0.,"**Answer**:

The HST paper identifies several anchor distances for the determination of H_0: NGC 4258 masers, Milky Way (MW) Cepheid parallaxes, LMC detached eclipsing binaries (DEBs), and M31 DEBs. However, M31 as an anchor had problems due to the lack of HST F555W data and time-series observations, making it difficult to use the same dereddening procedure as for other anchors, and because its DEB distances are based on early-type stars with significant systematic uncertainties. Therefore, M31 was conservatively excluded from the primary anchor set for H_0 determination, though its inclusion does not significantly change the result and its value is consistent with the other anchors.

M31 has problems being used as an anchor in the determination of H_0 in the HST paper primarily because the HST PHAT program did not use the F555W filter or include time-series data, making it impossible to use the same mean-light F555W−F814W colors to deredden the Cepheids as for other SH0ES galaxies.

The large difference between the optical and NIR Wesenheit magnitude systematic errors in the HST paper arises because the optical Wesenheit magnitudes are much more sensitive to uncertainties in the reddening law, metallicity effects, and breaks in the period-luminosity relation. Specifically, the value of the reddening parameter R is about four times larger in the optical than in the NIR, making the optical Wesenheit more susceptible to systematic shifts when the treatment of reddening, metallicity, or P–L relation is varied, leading to a larger systematic error compared to the NIR Wesenheit magnitudes, which are more robust against these systematics .

In the ACT DR6 paper, the n=3 EDE model is favoured over ΛCDM for the P-ACT-LB dataset at a significance level of 1.7σ, as determined by the likelihood-ratio test statistic (see Table 2 and related discussion).

97,"Does allowing electron mass and spatial curvature to vary at recombination explain the discrepancy between local and global values of H_0, according to the ACT DR6 paper?","Once the driving DESI BAO data was replaced with the BOSS BAO data, the H_0 fits shifted to be fully consistent with the \lambda-CDM value. Therefore, no, varying the electron mass and spatial curvature doesn't explain the discrepancy between the local and global values of H_0","**Answer**:

According to the ACT DR6 paper, allowing both the electron mass and spatial curvature to vary at recombination does open up degeneracies that permit higher values of H_0, but when late-time data (such as BAO and SNIa) are included, the resulting H_0 values are pulled back toward the standard ΛCDM value, and there is no significant improvement in fit compared to ΛCDM. Thus, this approach does not explain the discrepancy between local and global values of H_0, and the possibility of obtaining a high H_0 from cosmological data in this model is significantly reduced by the new ACT DR6 results .

98,How do the authors of the ACT DR6 paper constrain the effective number of relativistic species from the CMB power spectra?,N_{eff} alters the damping tail of the CMB power spectra and also induces a characteristic phase shift in the acoustic peaks.,"**Answer**:

The authors of the ACT DR6 paper constrain the effective number of relativistic species (Neff) by analyzing the impact of Neff on the CMB power spectra, particularly its effect on the expansion rate during the radiation-dominated era, which alters the damping tail and induces a phase shift in the acoustic peaks. They fit cosmological models to the ACT DR6 CMB power spectra (and combinations with Planck, lensing, and BAO data), finding that Neff is most tightly constrained by the high-ℓ (small-scale) TT and TE spectra, and report Neff = 2.86 ± 0.13 (68%, P-ACT-LB), consistent with the Standard Model expectation, and set upper limits on additional light relics by fitting for positive excesses in Neff due to new species, with robust tests across data subsets confirming the stability of the result  .

Removing these two points removes the tension between the f\sigma_8 dataset and the P-ACT and W-ACT datasets.,"**Answer**:

Including fσ8 measurements in the calculation of the growth index γ for modified gravity theories increases the tension with GR because these measurements, especially from RSD and peculiar velocity surveys, tend to prefer lower values of fσ8(z) at low redshift than predicted by ΛCDM/GR. This pulls the best-fit value of γ significantly above the GR value of 0.55, resulting in a >3σ deviation, and this tension is largely driven by a few low-redshift fσ8 data points with small error bars that lie below the CMB expectation, rather than by the CMB or other datasets themselves .
