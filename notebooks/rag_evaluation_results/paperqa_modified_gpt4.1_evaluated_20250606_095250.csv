1,How is the standard recombination history tested in the Planck 2018 analysis?,"**Answer**:

The Planck 2018 analysis tests the standard recombination history by comparing precise measurements of the CMB temperature, polarization, and lensing power spectra to theoretical predictions, and by performing a principal-component (eigenmode) analysis of perturbations to the free-electron fraction, $x_e(z)$; all results show no significant deviations from the standard recombination scenario and confirm the robustness of cosmological parameter estimates .

8,Why is there an apparent preference for A_L deviating from theoretical expectations in the Planck 2018 analysis?,"**Answer**:

The apparent preference for the lensing amplitude parameter $A_L$ deviating from the theoretical expectation of unity in the Planck 2018 analysis is primarily driven by oscillatory residuals in the high-multipole temperature power spectrum, which resemble the effect of increased lensing smoothing, and is further influenced by analysis choices, parameter degeneracies, and possible statistical fluctuations or unaccounted-for systematics in the polarization data (aghanim2020planck2018results chunks 10, 39, 40, 41). The effect is not robust, as it is sensitive to the construction of the likelihood and changes with analysis methodology, and is not corroborated by direct lensing reconstruction (aghanim2020planck2018results chunks 10, 38, 39).

The use of M31 as an anchor faced significant obstacles due to the lack of appropriate HST filter data and systematic uncertainties in DEB distances based on early-type stars, while the LMC anchor was affected by uncertainties from early-type DEBs requiring non-LTE models and differences in Cepheid properties; Milky Way Cepheids had zeropoint uncertainties between ground and HST photometric systems .
