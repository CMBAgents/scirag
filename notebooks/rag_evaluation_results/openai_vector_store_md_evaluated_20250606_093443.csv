1,How is the standard recombination history tested in the Planck 2018 analysis?,semi-blind eigen-analysis (often referred to as a principal-component analysis),"**Answer**:

The standard recombination history in the Planck 2018 analysis is tested using a semi-blind principal-component (eigenmode) analysis of perturbations to the free-electron fraction, x_e(z), across redshifts relevant for recombination.

8,Why is there an apparent preference for A_L deviating from theoretical expectations in the Planck 2018 analysis?,"In temperature, over half of the small upward shift in A_L is explained by the lower optical depth from the 2018 low-l likelihood, In polarization, the shift in A_L is explained by changes in \tau, with changes in the maps, modelling for beam leakage, and polarization efficiencies.","**Answer**:

The apparent preference for A_L deviating from theoretical expectations in the Planck 2018 analysis is primarily due to oscillatory residuals in the high-ℓ CMB power spectra (especially in the range ℓ = 1100–2000) that resemble the effect of increased lensing smoothing, leading to a best-fit value of A_L > 1. This preference is not fully explained by systematics or foregrounds and is reduced when including lensing reconstruction or external data, suggesting it may be a statistical fluctuation or related to analysis choices, rather than a robust indication of new physics beyond ΛCDM .

10,How are systematic errors in X-ray cluster masses corrected in the Planck analysis?,The X-ray cluster masses errors are corrected by multiplying the true masses by a “hydrostatic mass bias” factor.,"**Answer**:

Systematic errors in X-ray cluster masses in the Planck analysis are corrected by calibrating the hydrostatic mass bias, often denoted as (1-b), using independent mass estimates from weak gravitational lensing and CMB lensing. The Planck analysis incorporates these calibrations by adopting a prior on the mass bias parameter, with recent studies (e.g., Zubeldia & Challinor 2019) finding (1-b) = 0.71 ± 0.10, and by comparing results with external datasets to ensure consistency and account for systematic uncertainties in the mass calibration process.

The neural network of CAMELS can predict the evolution of a cosmological quantity, such as the star formation rate density (SFRD), with the redshift given cosmological and astrophysical parameters with an average precision of about 0.12 dex (for SIMBA) and 0.106 dex (for IllustrisTNG), capturing the general trend well but not the high-frequency variability due to cosmic variance. The network is able to learn the correct dependence of the SFRD on the parameters and can be used for fast exploration of parameter space, though its minimum achievable error is limited by cosmic variance, which is about 20% for these simulations .

This suggests that the autoencoder learned a general lower-dimensional manifold for temperature fields, rather than just memorizing the training data, and could even identify anomalies such as the CAMELS logo, which it reconstructed poorly except for background regions, indicating it had not simply learned to compress generic images but had captured the structure of the temperature maps specifically.

The paper explicitly discusses the possibility of numerical artifacts affecting the inference of Ω_m.

79,Which anchor distances had problems with being used as anchors in the determination of H_0 in the HST paper?,The distance to M31 had problems with being used as an anchor in the determination of H_0.,"**Answer**:

The HST paper identifies that the use of M31 as an anchor in the determination of H_0 has problems due to the lack of F555W filter and time-series data in the PHAT HST program, making it difficult to use the same dereddening procedure as for other anchors. Additionally, the DEB distances in M31 are based only on early-type stars, which have significant systematic uncertainties due to non-LTE stellar model atmospheres, so M31 was conservatively removed from the primary anchor set, though its value is consistent with the others. The LMC early-type DEBs are also considered less reliable than late-type DEBs for similar reasons, but the late-type DEBs are used for the LMC anchor in the main analysis.

The colours would have to be recalibrated.","**Answer**:

M31 has problems being used as an anchor in the determination of H_0 in the HST paper primarily because the HST PHAT program did not use the F555W filter or include time-series data, making it impossible to use the same individual, mean-light F555W-F814W colors to deredden the Cepheids in F160W as for other SH0ES galaxies.

The large difference between the optical and NIR Wesenheit magnitude systematic errors in the HST paper arises because the optical Wesenheit magnitudes are much more sensitive to systematics from reddening law, metallicity, period-luminosity relation breaks, and outlier rejection. The value of the reddening coefficient R is about four times larger in the optical, amplifying the impact of uncertainties in reddening and other systematics, so changes in these assumptions cause much larger shifts in H0 for the optical Wesenheit than for the NIR, making the systematic error in the optical considerably worse than in the NIR .

ACT DR6 mildly favours a positive value for the running of the spectral index, with the best-fit value being d n_s / d ln k = 0.0060 ± 0.0055 (68%, P-ACT), but this is consistent with zero at the 1σ level, and the results are described as confirming a vanishing running of the spectral index, in contrast to Planck which slightly preferred a negative running .

94,Which possible non-decaying isocurvature modes are considered in the ACT DR6 paper?,Cold dark matter density (CDI) and neutrino density (NDI) are considered directly. Baryon density (BDI) is considered indirectly.,"**Answer**:

The ACT DR6 paper considers four possible non-decaying isocurvature modes: cold dark matter density (CDI), baryon density (BDI), neutrino density (NDI), and neutrino velocity (NVI). However, only CDI and NDI are analyzed in detail, as BDI is observationally degenerate with CDI (differing only in amplitude), and NVI is less theoretically motivated; thus, the main focus is on CDI and NDI isocurvature modes in their constraints and analysis .

According to the ACT DR6 paper, allowing both the electron mass and spatial curvature to vary at recombination does open up degeneracies that permit higher values of H_0 in fits to CMB and BAO data, but this model does not yield a significant improvement in fit over ΛCDM, and the inclusion of SNIa data pulls the results back toward ΛCDM values, disfavoring this approach as a solution to the H_0 discrepancy.
